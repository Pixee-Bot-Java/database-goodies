## Database Goodies

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/susom/database-goodies.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/susom/database-goodies)

This project includes a variety of different things built on top of
the database library.

### Features

* Some basic ETL capabilities for moving data around efficiently between databases
* Database health checks for Vert.x based servers

In the future I plan to add expand the ETL functionality, add reporting and analytics,
and add an EAV model, among other things.
